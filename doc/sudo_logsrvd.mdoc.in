.Sh NAME
.Nm sudo_logsrvd
.Nd sudo event and I/O log server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm sudo_logsrvd
.Op Fl hnV
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl R Ar percentage
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a high-performance log server that accepts event and I/O logs from
.Nm sudo .
It can be used to implement centralized logging of
.Nm sudo
logs.
Event log entries may be logged either via
.Xr syslog 3
or to a file.
I/O Logs created by
.Nm
can be replayed via the
.Xr sudoreplay @mansectsu@
utility in the same way as logs generated directly by the
.Nm sudoers
plugin.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl f , -file
Read configuration from
.Ar file
instead of the default,
.Pa @sysconfdir@/sudo_logsrvd.conf .
.It Fl h , -help
Display a short help message to the standard output and exit.
.It Fl n , -no-fork
Run
.Nm
in the foreground instead of detaching from the terminal and becoming
a daemon.
.It Fl R , -random-drop
For each message, there is a
.Ar percentage
chance that the server will drop the connection.
This is only intended for debugging the ability of a
client to restart a connection.
.It Fl V , -version
Print the
.Nm
version and exit.
.El
.Pp
Configuration parameters for
.Nm
may be set in the
.Xr sudo_logsrvd.conf @mansectform@
file.
.Ss Debugging sudo_logsrvd
.Nm
supports a flexible debugging framework that is configured via
.Li Debug
lines in the
.Xr sudo.conf @mansectform@
file.
.Pp
For more information on configuring
.Xr sudo.conf @mansectform@ ,
please refer to its manual.
