.Sh NAME
.Nm sudo_logsrvd.conf
.Nd configuration for sudo_logsrvd
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm sudo_logsrvd.conf
file is used to configure the
.Nm sudo_logsrvd
log server.
It uses an INI-style format made up of sections in square brackets and
.Dq key = value
pairs specific to each section below the section name.
Depending on the key, values may be integers, booleans or strings.
Section and key names are not case sensitive, but values are.
.Pp
The pound sign
.Pq Ql #
is used to indicate a comment.
Both the comment character and any text after it, up to the end of
the line, are ignored.
Lines beginning with a semi-colon
.Pq Ql \&;
are also ignored.
.Pp
Long lines can be continued with a backslash
.Pq Ql \e
as the last character on the line.
Note that leading white space is removed from the beginning of lines
even when the continuation character is used.
.Pp
The
.Sx EXAMPLES
section contains a copy of the default
.Nm
file.
.Pp
The following configuration sections are recognized:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact -offset indent
.It
server
.It
iolog
.It
eventlog
.It
syslog
.It
logfile
.El
.Pp
Each section is described in detail below.
.Ss server
The
.Em server
section configures the address and port the server will listen on.
The following keys are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width 8n
.It listen_address = host Ns Op : Ns port
The host name or IP address and optional port to listen on.
If no port is specified, port 30344 will be used.
The host may be a host name, an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address
in square brackets or the wild card entry
.Ql * .
A host setting of
.Ql *
will cause
.Nm sudo_logsrvd
to listen on all configured network interfaces.
.Pp
If a port is specified, it may either be a port number or a known
service name as defined by the system service name database.
The default value is
.Li listen_address = *:30344
which will listen on all configured network interfaces.
Multiple
.Em listen_address
lines may be specified to listen on more than one interface.
.El
.Ss iolog
The
.Em iolog
section configures I/O log parameters.
These settings are identical to the I/O configuration in
.Xr sudoers @mansectform@ .
The following keys are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width 8n
.It iolog_compress = boolean
If set, I/O logs will be compressed using
.Sy zlib .
Enabling compression can make it harder to view the logs in real-time as
the program is executing due to buffering.
The default value is
.Li false .
.It iolog_dir = path
The top-level directory to use when constructing the path
name for the I/O log directory.
The session sequence number, if any, is stored in the directory.
The default value is
.Pa @iolog_dir@ .
.Pp
The following percent
.Pq Ql %
escape sequences are supported:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Li %{seq}
expanded to a monotonically increasing base-36 sequence number, such as 0100A5,
where every two digits are used to form a new directory, e.g.,
.Pa 01/00/A5
.It Li %{user}
expanded to the invoking user's login name
.It Li %{group}
expanded to the name of the invoking user's real group-ID
.It Li %{runas_user}
expanded to the login name of the user the command will
be run as (e.g., root)
.It Li %{runas_group}
expanded to the group name of the user the command will
be run as (e.g., wheel)
.It Li %{hostname}
expanded to the local host name without the domain name
.It Li %{command}
expanded to the base name of the command being run
.El
.Pp
In addition, any escape sequences supported by the system's
.Xr strftime 3
function will be expanded.
.Pp
To include a literal
.Ql %
character, the string
.Ql %%
should be used.
.It iolog_file = path
The path name, relative to
.Em iolog_dir ,
in which to store I/O logs.
Note that
.Em iolog_file
may contain directory components.
The default value is
.Li %{seq} .
.Pp
See the
.Em iolog_dir
setting above for a list of supported percent
.Pq Ql %
escape sequences.
.Pp
In addition to the escape sequences, path names that end in six or
more
.Li X Ns s
will have the
.Li X Ns s
replaced with a unique combination of digits and letters, similar to the
.Xr mktemp 3
function.
.Pp
If the path created by concatenating
.Em iolog_dir
and
.Em iolog_file
already exists, the existing I/O log file will be truncated and
overwritten unless
.Em iolog_file
ends in six or
more
.Li X Ns s .
.It iolog_flush = boolean
If set, I/O log data is flushed to disk after each write instead of
buffering it.
This makes it possible to view the logs in real-time as the program is
executing but may significantly reduce the effectiveness
of I/O log compression.
The default value is
.Li true .
.It iolog_group = name
The group name to look up when setting the group-ID on new I/O log
files and directories.
If
.Em iolog_group
is not set,
the primary group-ID of the user specified by
.Em iolog_user is used.
If neither
.Em iolog_group
nor
.Em iolog_user
are set, I/O log files and directories are created with group-ID 0.
.It iolog_mode = mode
The file mode to use when creating I/O log files.
Mode bits for read and write permissions for owner, group or other
are honored, everything else is ignored.
The file permissions will always include the owner read and
write bits, even if they are not present in the specified mode.
When creating I/O log directories, search (execute) bits are added
to match the read and write bits specified by
.Em iolog_mode .
The default value is
.Li 0600 .
.It iolog_user = name
The user name to look up when setting the owner of new
I/O log files and directories.
If
.Em iolog_group
is set, it will be used instead of the user's primary group-ID.
By default, I/O log files and directories are created with user and
group-ID 0.
.It maxseq = number
The maximum sequence number that will be substituted for the
.Dq Li %{seq}
escape in the I/O log file (see the
.Em iolog_dir
description above for more information).
While the value substituted for
.Dq Li %{seq}
is in base 36,
.Em maxseq
itself should be expressed in decimal.
Values larger than 2176782336 (which corresponds to the
base 36 sequence number
.Dq ZZZZZZ )
will be silently truncated to 2176782336.
The default value is 2176782336.
.El
.Ss eventlog
The
.Em eventlog
section configures how (and if) security policy events are logged.
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It log_type = string
Where to log accept, reject and alert events reported by the policy.
Supported values are
.Em syslog ,
.Em logfile ,
and
.Em none .
The default value is
.Em syslog .
.It log_format = string
The event log format.
Currently, only sudo-style event logs are supported.
Other log formats may be added in the future.
The default value is
.Em sudo .
.El
.Ss syslog
The
.Em syslog
section configures how events are logged via
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It facility = string
Syslog facility if syslog is being used for logging.
Defaults to
.Li @logfac@ .
.Pp
The following syslog facilities are supported:
.Sy authpriv
(if your
OS supports it),
.Sy auth ,
.Sy daemon ,
.Sy user ,
.Sy local0 ,
.Sy local1 ,
.Sy local2 ,
.Sy local3 ,
.Sy local4 ,
.Sy local5 ,
.Sy local6 ,
and
.Sy local7 .
.It accept_priority = string
Syslog priority to use when the user is allowed to run a command and
authentication is successful.
Defaults to
.Li @goodpri@ .
.Pp
The following syslog priorities are supported:
.Sy alert ,
.Sy crit ,
.Sy debug ,
.Sy emerg ,
.Sy err ,
.Sy info ,
.Sy notice ,
.Sy warning ,
and
.Sy none .
Setting it to a value of
.Sy none
will disable logging of successful commands.
.It reject_priority = string
Syslog priority to use when the user is not allowed to run a command or
when authentication is unsuccessful.
Defaults to
.Li @badpri@ .
.Pp
See
.Em accept_priority
for the list of supported syslog priorities.
.It alert_priority = string
Syslog priority to use for event log alert messages received from the client.
Defaults to
.Li @badpri@ .
.Pp
See
.Em accept_priority
for the list of supported syslog priorities.
.It maxlen = number
On many systems,
.Xr syslog 3
has a relatively small log buffer.
IETF RFC 5424 states that syslog servers must support messages of
at least 480 bytes and should support messages up to 2048 bytes.
By default,
.Nm sudo_logsrvd
creates log messages up to 980 bytes which corresponds to the
historic
.Bx
syslog implementation which used a 1024 byte buffer
to store the message, date, hostname and program name.
.Pp
To prevent syslog messages from being truncated,
.Nm sudo_logsrvd
will split up log messages that are larger than
.Em maxlen
bytes.
When a message is split, additional parts will include the string
.Dq Pq command continued
after the user name and before the continued command line arguments.
.El
.Ss logfile
The
.Em logfile
section consists of settings related to logging to a plain file
(not syslog).
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It path = string
The path to the file-based event log.
This path must be fully-qualified and start with a
.Sq /
character.
The default value is
.Pa @logpath@ .
.It time_format = string
The string used when formatting the date and time for file-based event logs.
Formatting is performed via the system's
.Xr strftime 3
function so any escape sequences supported by that function will be expanded.
The default value is
.Dq Li "%h %e %T"
which produces dates like
.Dq Oct  3 07:15:24
in the C locale.
