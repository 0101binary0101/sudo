.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
is a high-performance log server that accepts event and I/O logs from
\fBsudo\fR.
It can be used to implement centralized logging of
\fBsudo\fR
logs.
Event log entries may be logged either via
syslog(3)
or to a file.
I/O Logs created by
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
can be replayed via the
sudoreplay(@mansectsu@)
utility in the same way as logs generated directly by the
\fBsudoers\fR
plugin.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP 12n
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\--file\fR
Read configuration from
\fIfile\fR
instead of the default,
\fI@sysconfdir@/sudo_logsrvd.conf\fR.
.TP 12n
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\--help\fR
Display a short help message to the standard output and exit.
.TP 12n
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\--no-fork\fR
Run
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
in the the foreground instead of detaching from the terminal and becoming
a daemon.
.TP 12n
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\--random-drop\fR
For each message, there is a
\fIpercentage\fR
chance that the server will drop the connection.
This is only intended for debugging the ability of a
client to restart a connection.
.TP 12n
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\--version\fR
Print the
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
version and exit.
.PP
Configuration parameters for
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
may be set in the
sudo_logsrvd.conf(@mansectform@)
file.
.SS "Debugging sudo_logsrvd"
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
supports a flexible debugging framework that is configured via
\fRDebug\fR
lines in the
sudo.conf(@mansectform@)
file.
