[server]
# The host name or IP address and port to listen on.  If no port is
# specified, port 30344 will be used.
# The following forms are accepted:
#   listen_address = hostname
#   listen_address = hostname:port
#   listen_address = IPv4_address
#   listen_address = IPv4_address:port
#   listen_address = [IPv6_address]
#   listen_address = [IPv6_address]:port
# 
# Multiple listen_address settings may be specified.
# The default is to listen on all addresses.
#listen_address = *:30344

[iolog]
# The top-level directory to use when constructing the path name for the
# I/O log directory.  The session sequence number, if any, is stored here.
#iolog_dir = /var/log/sudo-io

# The path name, relative to iolog_dir, in which to store I/O logs.
# Note that iolog_file may contain directory components.
#iolog_file = %{seq}

# If set, I/O log data is flushed to disk after each write instead of
# buffering it.  This makes it possible to view the logs in real-time
# as the program is executing but may significantly reduce the effectiveness
# of I/O log compression.
#iolog_flush = true

# If set, I/O logs will be compressed using zlib.  Enabling compression can
# make it harder to view the logs in real-time as the program is executing.
#iolog_compress = false

# The group name to look up when setting the group-ID on new I/O log files
# and directories.  If iolog_group is not set, the primary group-ID of the
# user specified by iolog_user is used.  If neither iolog_group nor iolog_user
# are set, I/O log files and directories are created with group-ID 0.
#iolog_group = wheel

# The user name to look up when setting the user and group-IDs on new I/O
# log files and directories.  If iolog_group is set, it will be used instead
# of the user's primary group-ID.  By default, I/O log files and directories
# are created with user and group-ID 0.
#iolog_user = root

# The file mode to use when creating I/O log files.  Mode bits for read and
# write permissions for owner, group or other are honored, everything else
# is ignored.  The file permissions will always include the owner read and
# write bits, even if they are not present in the specified mode.  When
# creating I/O log directories, search (execute) bits are added to match
# the read and write bits specified by iolog_mode.
#iolog_mode = 0600

# The maximum sequence number that will be substituted for the %{seq}
# escape in the I/O log file (see the iolog_dir description below for
# more information).  While the value substituted for %{seq} is in
# base 36, maxseq itself should be expressed in decimal.  Values larger
# than 2176782336 (which corresponds to the base 36 sequence number
# ZZZZZZ) will be silently truncated to 2176782336.
#maxseq = 2176782336

[eventlog]
# Where to log accept, reject and alert events.
# Accepted values are syslog, logfile, or none.
# Defaults to syslog
#log_type = syslog

# Event log format.
# Currently only supports sudo-style event logs.
#log_format = sudo

[syslog]
# The maximum length of a syslog payload.
# On many systems, syslog(3) has a relatively small log buffer.
# IETF RFC 5424 states that syslog servers must support messages
# of at least 480 bytes and should support messages up to 2048 bytes.
# Messages larger than this value will be split into multiple messages.
#maxlen = 960

# The syslog facility to use for event log messages.
# The following syslog facilities are supported: authpriv (if your OS
# supports it), auth, daemon, user, local0, local1, local2, local3, local4,
# local5, local6, and local7.
#facility = authpriv

# The syslog priority to use for event log accept messages, when
# the command is allowed by the security policy.  The following syslog
# priorities are supported: alert, crit, debug, emerg, err, info,
# notice, warning, and none.
#accept_priority = notice

# The syslog priority to use for event log reject messages, when the
# command is not allowed by the security policy.
#reject_priority = alert

# The syslog priority to use for event log alert messages reported
# by the security policy.
#alert_priority = alert

[logfile]
# The format string used when formatting the date and time for
# file-based event logs.  Formatting is performed via strftime(3) so
# any format string supported by that function is allowed.
#time_format = %h %e %T

# The path to the file-based event log.
# This path must be fully-qualified and start with a '/' character.
#path = /var/log/sudo
